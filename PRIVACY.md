# Privacy Policy for Toolarr

**Last Updated:** July 17, 2025

This privacy policy outlines the data handling practices for the Toolarr API service.

### 1. No Data Collection

This service is designed to be completely stateless. We do not collect, store, log, or share any personal information or user data.

### 2. Data Processing

The Toolarr service acts as a pass-through API bridge. When you make a request, the following occurs:

* The request is authenticated using your private API key.
* The command is forwarded to your self-hosted Sonarr or Radarr instance(s).
* The response from your Sonarr or Radarr instance is returned directly to you.

No data from this process is logged or retained by the Toolarr service.

### 3. Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
