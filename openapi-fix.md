This is a classic OpenAPI configuration error. The message "Could not find a valid URL in `servers`" means exactly what it says: the `openapi.json` file that your application generates is missing the required `servers` block, which tells ChatGPT where to send the API requests.

Your application code needs to be updated to include this information when it generates the schema.

### The Fix: Add the `servers` attribute in `main.py`

You need to modify the file `main.py` to tell your FastAPI application what its public address is.

**1. Open `main.py`**

**2. Find this line:**
```python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Toolarr: Sonarr and Radarr API Tool Server",
    version="2.0.0",
    description="OpenAPI server for Sonarr and Radarr integration with Open WebUI",
)
```

**3. Add the `servers` attribute to it, like this:**
```python
# --- App Initialization ---
app = FastAPI(
    title="Toolarr: Sonarr and Radarr API Tool Server",
    version="2.0.0",
    description="OpenAPI server for Sonarr and Radarr integration with Open WebUI",
    servers=[
        {
            "url": "https://toolarr.moderncaveman.us",
            "description": "Production server"
        }
    ]
)
```

### What Happens Next

After you make this change and redeploy your `toolarr` stack, the `https://toolarr.moderncaveman.us/openapi.json` file will now contain the following block at the top level of the JSON:

```json
"servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://toolarr.moderncaveman.us",
      "description": "Production server"
    }
],
```

Once the schema contains this `servers` block, the ChatGPT connector will know where to send the API calls, and the import error will be resolved.
