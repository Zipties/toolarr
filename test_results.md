# Toolarr API Test Results

## ✅ Working Features

### 1. API Foundation
- OpenAPI spec accessible at `/openapi.json`
- Bearer token authentication working correctly
- API responds on configured port

### 2. Instance Management
- ✅ List Sonarr instances: `/instances/sonarr`
- ✅ List Radarr instances: `/instances/radarr`
- ✅ "default" instance name works (falls back to first configured instance)

### 3. Library Management
- ✅ Search TV shows in Sonarr with quality profile names included
- ✅ Search movies in Radarr with quality profile names included
- ✅ Library with tag names endpoint working (`/library/with-tags`)
- ✅ Tag names are properly mapped from IDs

### 4. Quality Profiles
- ✅ List quality profiles for Sonarr
- ✅ List quality profiles for Radarr

### 5. Tag Management
- ✅ List tags for both Sonarr and Radarr
- ✅ Create new tags
- ✅ Update series/movie tags (with proper object schema)
- ✅ Tag IDs properly replaced with all existing tags

### 6. Queue Management
- ✅ View download queues for both services
- ✅ Queue returns empty array when no items

## ❌ Issues Found

### 1. History Endpoint
- **Error**: Response validation error - missing 'status' field
- **Impact**: Cannot retrieve download history

### 2. Queue Deletion
- **Error**: "Error communicating with Radarr: Expecting value"
- **Impact**: Cannot delete items from queue

### 3. Case-Insensitive Instance Names
- **Error**: "Sonarr instance 'SONARR' not found"
- **Impact**: Instance names must match case exactly

### 4. Missing Endpoints
- Root folders endpoint not found
- Tag deletion endpoint not implemented
- Series update endpoint not found

### 5. Move Functionality
- Not tested due to missing endpoints/documentation

## 📋 API Compliance with README

### Features Promised vs Delivered:
- ✅ Search for movies and TV shows
- ✅ View quality profiles
- ✅ Automatic Profile Names included in responses
- ✅ Clear Service Distinction (separate Sonarr/Radarr paths)
- ✅ Multiple instance support
- ✅ Bearer token authentication
- ✅ Tag management (partial - no deletion)
- ⚠️ Move content between folders (endpoint exists but not fully tested)
- ⚠️ Update series monitoring (endpoint missing)
- ⚠️ Delete items from queue (error in implementation)
- ❌ Check download history (validation error)

## 🔧 Recommendations

1. Fix the history endpoint response model to include required 'status' field
2. Debug queue deletion endpoint JSON parsing issue
3. Implement case-insensitive instance name matching as designed
4. Add missing endpoints: root folders, tag deletion, series update
5. Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases
6. Update documentation to reflect actual available endpoints

## Overall Assessment

The API successfully provides core functionality for AI integration with Sonarr and Radarr, particularly for search, library browsing, and tag management. The quality profile names feature works as advertised, making it easy for AI to understand user preferences. However, some advanced features need fixes or implementation to match the README promises fully.
